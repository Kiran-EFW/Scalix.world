   ├── page.tsx           # Main dashboard page
   ├── projects/
   │   └── page.tsx       # Projects management
   ├── usage/
   │   └── page.tsx       # Usage analytics
   ├── billing/
   │   └── page.tsx       # Billing & subscription
   ├── team/
   │   └── page.tsx       # Team management
   └── settings/
       └── page.tsx       # User settings
   ```

3. **Dashboard** → User sees overview and navigates to specific features
4. **Project Management** → User creates and manages AI projects
5. **Usage & Billing** → User monitors usage and manages billing
6. **Settings** → User configures preferences and API keys

### Admin User Flow
1. **Admin Login** → Admin accesses admin panel
2. **System Health** → Monitor system performance
3. **User Management** → Manage user accounts and permissions
