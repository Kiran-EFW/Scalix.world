# ðŸš€ **TOMORROW'S CONTINUATION PROMPT**

## ðŸ“‹ **COPY THIS PROMPT TO CONTINUE TOMORROW:**

```
I need to continue working on the Scalix dashboard implementation. Here's the current status:

**COMPLETED (75% Done):**
âœ… Project Management - Full CRUD operations working
âœ… Settings Management - All user settings functional  
âœ… Marketing Fixes - External AI mentions removed
âœ… Technical Fixes - CORS, Stripe, date formatting resolved

**PENDING (25% Remaining):**
ðŸš§ Team Management - Invite Member, Export Team, Message
ðŸš§ Usage Analytics - Export, Refresh, Filter functionality  
ðŸš§ Billing Actions - Plan Settings, View Detailed Usage

**CURRENT ENVIRONMENT:**
- Server running on http://localhost:3000
- Working directory: C:\Users\kiran\Downloads\Scalix-AI-master\Scalix.world web
- Development mode with auto-authentication enabled

**IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN TO FOLLOW:**
1. Create API route (/api/[feature]/route.ts) with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
2. Update frontend (/app/dashboard/[feature]/page.tsx) with React state management
3. Test with Playwright MCP browser automation
4. Ensure loading states, success/error feedback, real-time updates

**NEXT PRIORITY:** Start with Team Management - implement Invite Member functionality first.

**FILES TO REFERENCE:**
- scalix-test-screenshots/HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md (complete status)
- scalix-test-screenshots/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS.md (pattern example)
- scalix-test-screenshots/SETTINGS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS.md (pattern example)

Please continue from where we left off and implement the Team Management functionality using the established pattern.
